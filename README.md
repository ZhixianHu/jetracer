# JetRacer - Dual-drive version

This is a modified version of NVIDIA-AI-IOT/JetRacer to meet the need of controlling dual-drive smart cars.

The original version is [JetRacer](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/jetracer). For the single-drive smart cars, please refer to the former link.

To get started, follow the [setup](#setup) below.

<!--#### Examples-->

<!--JetRacer comes with a couple examples to get you up and running.  The examples are in the format of Jupyter Notebooks, which are interactive documents which combine text, code, and visualization.  Once you've completed the notebooks, start tweaking them to create your own racing software!-->

<!--#### Example 1 - Basic motion-->

<!--In this example you'll learn to progam JetRacer programatically from your web browser.  Learn more in the [examples](docs/examples.md) documentation.-->

<!--#### Example 2 - Road following-->

<!--In this example, you'll teach JetRacer how to follow a road using AI.  After training the neural network using the [interactive training notebook](notebooks/interactive_regression.ipynb), you'll optimize the model using NVIDIA TensorRT and deploy for a live demo. Learn more in the [examples](docs/examples.md).-->
